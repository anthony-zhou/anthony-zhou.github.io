I"Á<p>The purpose of this document is to provide a guide to the open source initiatives working to fight the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Read on if you would like to help out.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Open source technology</strong> refers to projects where the source code is freely available to the public, many of which would welcome anyone who can contribute.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If youâ€™re interested in contributing, see if these projects have issues in their GitHub repositories or other tasks that you might be able to help with. If you donâ€™t think you have enough technical expertise, help spread the word! See if any of your friends and family might be able to help out with open source (1) Software or (2) Hardware.</p>

<h2 id="1-software">1. Software</h2>
<p>In the table below you will find a few open source projects to contribute to/look at. <a href="https://github.com/soroushchehresa/awesome-coronavirus">Here is a more complete list</a> (note that the projects with more stars are probably more impactful and better to contribute to).</p>

<h2 id="2-hardware">2. Hardware</h2>
<p>Probably even more important than software right now is open source hardware. Current projects include low-cost ventilators, PCR tools, and distributed computing. Whether youâ€™re a designer, builder, or anything in between, these projects could use your help! Contributing is not as standardized as with software, so Iâ€™d suggest you go join the <a href="https://discord.gg/duAtG5h">Open Hardware Summit Discord Server</a> to find out how you can help (they have a #covid-19 channel).</p>

<p>For an introduction to some of the biggest projects going on right now, check out <a href="https://opensource.com/article/20/3/open-hardware-covid19">this article</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and best of luck contributing. Stay safe out there!</p>
