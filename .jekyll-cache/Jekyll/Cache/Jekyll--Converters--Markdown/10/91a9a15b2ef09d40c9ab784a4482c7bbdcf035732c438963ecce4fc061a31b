<p><em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em> is a groundbreaking work by a giant in the world of behavioral economics and psychology. The book is long but well-paced, with each chapter delivering new insights into our psychology. What I love most about this book is how it goes beyond saying “our behavior is irrational” to present an organized framework for the mind, consisting of the analytical System 1 and the intuitive System 2. Read enough Kahneman and you will find yourself noticing the heuristics and biases we apply on a daily basis, and reconsidering the role they should play in decision-making.</p>

<p>Stick around till the end for some tips on how to live a more fulfilling life.</p>
