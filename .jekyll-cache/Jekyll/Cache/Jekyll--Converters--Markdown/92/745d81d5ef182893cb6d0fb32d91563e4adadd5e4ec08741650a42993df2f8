I"“<p>PDF documents are great because they preserve the format of a page. In other words, the content in a PDF document typically does not get distorted, pixelated, stretched, or compressed. Because of this, an image, once it‚Äôs been converted to a PDF, will typically preserve its dimensions and clarity. Making sure an image always looks sharp and focused is almost always a concern of designers, developers, and even just regular old people. When making a site that deals with images, developers may increasingly consider implementing ‚ÄúSave as PDF‚Äù as an attractive option for exporting an image. That‚Äôs why I decided to document some of the successes and struggles I encountered while working on this feature.</p>
