Today, Vincent Van Gogh is indisputably recognized as a gifted creative. In his lifetime, however, he was unsuccessful by nearly every measure of the word: his art was never commercially appreciated, and many of his contemporaries considered him a madman. Suffering from severe depression for his whole life, van Gogh famously severed part of his own left ear, after an argument prompted him to start hearing voices. When he was thirty-seven years old, van Gogh walked out into a field and shot himself with a revolver.

Van Gogh represents the classic ideal of the tortured artist. Alienated, misunderstood, yet ruthlessly innovative. Strangely enough, he is not alone in this predicament. Some of history's greatest creatives were notably depressed, including Ernest Hemingway (*The Old Man and the Sea*, *A Farewell to Arms*), Sylvia Plath (*The Bell Jar*), and George Orwell (*1984*, *Animal Farm*). It's enough to make one wonder if the trope of the tortured genius is not the exception but in fact is the rule.

Our increasing understanding of neuroscience and psychology gives us revolutionary insights into how our brains work. This knowledge allows us to explore the surprising links between mood and productivity. Used properly, this knowledge could enhance creativity and work output, all without compromising life satisfaction. In this series of articles, I will draw on history and science to address a controversial series of questions:
- Is there any truth to the trope of the tortured genius?
- Does happiness improve memory?
- How can happiness be enhanced?
- Does negativity improve focus?
- How can *negativity* be enhanced?
